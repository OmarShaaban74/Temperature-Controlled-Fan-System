# Temperature-Controlled-Fan-System
## A fan system that automatically adjusts fan speed according to temperature

#### 1. Create a fan system that automatically adjusts fan speed according to temperature using an ATmega32 microcontroller operating at 1MHz.
#### 2. The LM35 temperature sensor provided continuous analog output, converted to digital values by the ADC.
#### 3. The temperature values were displayed on an LCD screen for easy monitoring.
#### 4. The microcontroller continuously monitored the temperature and controlled the fan as follows:
  ##### - <30°C: Fan Off
  ##### - ≥30°C: Fan at 25% speed
  ##### - ≥60°C: Fan at 50% speed
  ##### - ≥90°C: Fan at 75% speed
  ##### - ≥120°C: Fan at 100% speed
#### 5. The circuit managed fan state and DC motor direction based on temperature.
#### 6. We harnessed PWM signals generated by Timer0 to control the DC motor's speed.

### The project was meticulously designed and implemented based on a layered architecture model, with specific driver requirements:
#### APP
#### HAL ( LCD , LM35 Sensor , Motor )
#### MCAL ( GPIO , ADC , PWM )
